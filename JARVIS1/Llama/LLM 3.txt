# 🧠 Personal JARVIS AI Assistant (Offline, Local LLM)

This project is a **personal JARVIS-like AI assistant** that runs **completely offline** on our system.  
It uses a **local LLaMA 3 model (GGUF)** executed through **KoboldCpp**, a **FastAPI backend** for communication,  
a **web-based chat UI**, and **Pinecone** to store & recall your personal knowledge.

✅>Download LLaMA Model (Required)

The LLaMA model is not included because it is larger than GitHub’s upload limit.

Download this file manually:
https://huggingface.co/QuantFactory/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf

Place it inside:
Llama/

✅ 2. Download KoboldCpp (Model Runner)

KoboldCpp is required to load and run the .gguf model locally.

Download the Windows executable here:

https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/releases

koboldcpp_cublas.exe


Place it in the same folder:

JARVIS/Llama/
